 CITED EXAMPLES FROM REDDIT:
- r/lucknow Reading Cafe / Reader' Club? → Ajay is seeking a sense of community and familiarity in a new city, as evidenced by his post asking about a reading club in Lucknow.
- r/lucknow Malls are a thing of past - and entire LKO is on steroids in rents cost, despite low to no demand. → Ajay is frustrated by the high cost of living and lack of demand for luxury goods in Lucknow, as shown by his comment about the inflated rent prices in the city's malls.
- r/nagpur I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go. He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly. → Ajay's experience with bribery and corruption reveals his frustration with the police force in Lucknow, as well as his preference for dealing with intermediaries rather than directly paying bribes to police officers.
- r/lucknow A menu easy to cook/process - healthy and quick. → Ajay's comment about desiring a menu that is easy to cook and quick reveals his preference for home-cooked meals, likely due to his need to work long hours and his focus on health and quality. Additionally, his comment about a tiffin having palm oil shows his concern for the quality of food in restaurants and eateries in Lucknow.
